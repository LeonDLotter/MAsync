## Main analyses and results:

- ***[MAsync_analyses.ipynb](MAsync_analyses.ipynb)***: Jupyter notebook to reproduce all analyses except for resting-state data processing. Contains general descriptions of methods and results.
- ***[data/datasets/fmri_coordinates.csv](data/datasets/fmri_coordinates.csv)***: Coordinates and associated study information from fMRI interpersonal neural synchrony studies
- ***[data/datasets/fnirs_coordinates.csv](data/datasets/fnirs_coordinates.csv)***: Coordinates and associated study information from fNIRS interpersonal neural synchrony studies

## All data, code, figures, & literature search result:

#### `/data`
Contains all results, see separate [README](data/README.md) file.

#### `/fig`
Contains code to reproduce figures and the associated files.

#### `/lit` 
Contains results from different stages of the literature search as *.ris files.

#### `/src` 
Contains all functions called in the analysis notebook. Also includes a development version of the [JuSpyce](https://github.com/LeonDLotter/JuSpyce) toolbox.

## Reproduce the analyses

To ease the reproduction of our analyses, we added dependency management via poetry to this repository. To create a virtual python environment with all the package versions we used, perform the steps below. However, you can also install all required packages manually in a python 3.8.8 environment.  

###  Poetry on osx/ linux
Install via curl:  
```
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python -
```
###  Poetry on windows
Install via powershell:  
```
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | python -
```
### Test if poetry was correctly installed:  
```
poetry --version
```
If the command is not found, add poetry to the `PATH` environment variable via:  
```
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.poetry/bin
```
### Run virtual environment
Go to the folder you downloaded the repository to, start a new terminal, and get synchronized :sunglasses:
```
poetry shell  
poetry install
```

Three toolboxes were developed partly in the context of this paper:  
- [SetYouFree](https://github.com/ChristianGerloff/set-you-free): A tool for automated literature retrieval from API-accessible databases  
- [JuSpyce](https://github.com/LeonDLotter/JuSpyce): A - wait for it - s**py**ced up Python adaptation of the [JuSpace](https://github.com/juryxy/JuSpace) toolbox, incorporating numerous strategies to test for alignment between multimodal neuroimaging data  
- [ABAnnotate](https://github.com/LeonDLotter/ABAnnotate): A MATLAB toolbox for ensemble-based multimodal gene-category enrichment analysis of human neuroimaging data
