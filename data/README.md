## Content

#### `/ale`
Contains results of the ALE analyses, with the following naming convention.  
Analyses:

- **ale_{}**: fMRI data, voxel-level threshold p < 0.001 (default)
- **ale01_{}**: fMRI data, voxel-level threshold p < 0.01
- **aleFNIRS_{}**: fMRI & all fNIRS data
- **aleFNIRSSEL_{}**: fMRI & selected fNIRS data
- **aleNoPseudo_{}**: fMRI data, excluding pseudo-hyperscanning experiments

Output types:

- **{}\_p.nii.gz, {}\_stat.nii.gz, {}\_z.nii.gz**: unthresholded p-, ale-, p-to-z-values
- **{}\_{logp | z}\_desc-{mass | size}\_level-cluster\_corr-FWE\_method-montecarlo.nii.gz**: cluster-level-corrected volumes of z or negative log(p) values
- **{}\_{logp | z}\_level-voxel\_corr-FWE\_method-montecarlo.nii.gz**: voxel-level-corrected volumes of z or negative log(p) values
- **{}\_thresh\_4d.nii.gz**: volumes thresholded at cluster-level p < 0.05, 4D-volume with one binarized volume for each cluster
- **{}\_thresh\_bin.nii.gz**: volumes thresholded at cluster-level p < 0.05, all clusters binarized
- **{}\_thresh\_idx.nii.gz**: volumes thresholded at cluster-level p < 0.05, clusters labelled from 1 to n_clusters
- **{}\_thresh\_{stat | z}.nii.gz**: volumes thresholded at cluster-level p < 0.05, ale or z-values, not binarized
- **ale\_thresh\_{}.csv**: tables with anatomical cluster and peak information

#### `/atlases`
Used templates, parcellations, and meta-analytic maps. For sources, refer to separate [README](atlases/README.md).

#### `/context`
Results from contextualization analyses: Distributions of the INS map within meta-analytic maps, conjunction volumes with prior meta-analytic maps, neurosynth topic decoding results, results from spatial correlation with PET and mRNA expression maps, JuSpace null maps.

- **/gcea**: results from gene-category enrichment analyses using [ABAnnotate](https://github.com/LeonDLotter/ABAnnotate). Note: the *.mat with results from the GeneOntology-BiologicalProcess annotations was not uploaded (size > 200mb). You can generate it using the analysis notebook and ABAnnotate or request it.
- **/parcel\_maps**: parcellated volumes generated from parcellated PET data for analysis with [JuSpace](https://github.com/juryxy/JuSpace)
- **/topic\_maps**: meta-analytic maps generated from Neurosynth LDA topic-decoding selected from the 200-topic LDA dataset

#### `/datasets`
Datasets used for all analyses. **This includes the coordinate data for fNIRS and fMRI studies collected in this work!**

- **/neurosynth**: the downloaded neurosynth database version 7
- **brainmap\_NormMapActOnly\_{}.pkl.gz**: "normal mapping" & "activation only" experiments from the BrainMap database as a NiMARE dataset
- **fmri\_coordinates**: INS fMRI coordinates and associated study information
- **fnirs\_coordinates**: INS FNIRS coordinates and associated study information
- **pet\_parcellated**: parcellated PET data

#### `/fnirs`
Contains fNIRS INS results.

- **fnirs\_atlas\_result\_{}.csv**: parcel-wise summarized fNIRS data, 'sel': only post-hoc selected studies
- **fnirs\_atas\_{}\_{}.nii.gz**: volumes with parcel-wise results (see notebook)
- **fnirs\_coordinates\_nearest\_{}.csv**: original and nearest within-atlas fNIRS coordinates
- **fnirs\_ale\_contributions.csv**: contributions of fNIRS studies to clusters obtained in joines fMRI+fNIRS ALE
- **fnirs\_ale\_randomization.csv**: result from repeated ALE analysis when fNIRS coordinates were slightly randomized

#### `/fsn`
Contains ALE results (see above) of the Fail-Safe-N analysis, only last iteration (original coordinates + the largest number of noise studies that can be added to the original ALE before the rTPJ cluster looses significance).

#### `/loeo`
ALE results (see above) of all fMRI Leave-One-Experiment-Out ALEs. Additionally, the conjunction volume of all LOEO ALEs and csv's with experiment-wise contributions to the fMRI ALE clusters

#### `/macm`
Contains inputs and results for/of MACM analyses (for naming see above).

#### `/rsfc`
Contains RSFC results.

- **fwd.csv**: motion estimates (frame-wise displacement) for exclusion of RSFC subjects 
- **macm\_rTPJ\_idx\_forConn.nii/.csv**: uncompressed MACM volume with associated cluster labels
- **rsfc\_cormat{}.csv**: averaged, thresholded and unthresholded semipartial z-transformed correlation matrix between MACM-ROIs
- **rsfc\_macm\_rTPJ\_semipartial.mat**: RSFC result from CONN toolbox
